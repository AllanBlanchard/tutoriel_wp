  -100 <= x <= 100 is a correct loop invariant.

  ----  ESTABLISHMENT
  -100 <= 0 <= 100 is verified

  ----  PRESERVATION
  For any iteration, we have -100 <= x <= 100.

  -  If x <= -10, we leave the loop and the invariant is verified
  -  If x >  -10, we have -10 < x <= 100.
     After the block of the loop, we have: -10 <= x < 100 which implies -100 <= x <= 100.
