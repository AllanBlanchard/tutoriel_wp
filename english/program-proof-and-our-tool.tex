The goal of this first part is, in the first section, to introduce the
idea of program proof without giving too many details, and then, in the
second section, to give the necessary instructions to install Frama-C
and some automatic provers that we will use in this tutorial.

Our tools are now installed and ready to be used.



The goal of this section, apart from the installation of our tools was to put
in relief two main ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item program proof is a way to ensure, without executing them, that our programs
  have only correct behaviors, which are described by our specification,
\item it is still our work to ensure that this specification is correct.
\end{itemize}
