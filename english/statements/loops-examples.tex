\levelThreeTitle{Examples with read-only arrays}


The array is the most common data structure when we are working with loops.
It is then a good example base to exercise with loops, and these
examples allow to rapidly show interesting invariants and will allow us
to introduce some important ACSL constructs.



We can for example use the search function that allows to find a value
inside an array:


\CodeBlockInput{c}{search.c}



There are enough ideas inside this example to introduce some important
syntax.



First, as we previously presented, the
\CodeInline{\textbackslash{}valid\_read} predicate (as well as
\CodeInline{\textbackslash{}valid}) allows us to specify not only the
validity of read-only address but also to state that a range of
contiguous addresses is valid. It is expressed using this expression:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
//@ requires \valid_read(a + (0 .. length-1));
\end{CodeBlock}



Cette pré-condition nous atteste que les adresses a+0, a+1 ..., a+length-1 sont
valides en lecture.



This precondition states that all addresses a+0, a+1, \ldots{},
a+length-1 are valid read-only locations.

We also introduced two notations that are used almost all the time in
ACSL, the keywords \CodeInline{\textbackslash{}forall} ($\forall$) and
\CodeInline{\textbackslash{}exists} ($\exists$), the universal logic
quantifiers. The first allows to state that for any element, some
property is true, the second allows to say that there exists some
element such that the property is true. If we comment a little bit the
corresponding lines in our specification, we can read them this way:


\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
// for all "off" of type "size_t", such that IF "off" is comprised between 0 and "length"
//                                 THEN the cell "off" in "a" is different from "element"
\forall size_t off ; 0 <= off < length ==> a[off] != element;

// there exists "off" of type "size_t", such that "off" is comprised between 0 and "length"
//                                      AND the cell "off" in "a" equals to "element"
\exists size_t off ; 0 <= off < length && a[off] == element;
*/
\end{CodeBlock}



If we want to summarize the use of these keyword, we would say that on a
range of values, a property is true, either about at least one of them
or about all of them. A common scheme is to constrain this set using
another property (here: \CodeInline{0 <= off < length}) puis nous voudrons prouver la
propriété réelle qui nous intéresse à propos d'eux.  and to prove the
actual interesting property on this smaller set. \textbf{But using
\texttt{exists} and \texttt{forall} is fundamentally different}.



With \CodeInline{\textbackslash{}forall type a ; p(a) ==> q(a)},
the constraint \CodeInline{p} is followed by an implication.
For any element where a first property \CodeInline{p} is verified, we have
to also verify the second property `\CodeInline{q}. If we use a conjunction,
as we do for ``exists'' (which we will later explain), that would mean that
all elements verify both \CodeInline{p} and \CodeInline{q}. Sometimes, it
could be what we want to express, but it would then not correspond
anymore to the idea of constraining a set for which we want to verify
some other property



With \CodeInline{\textbackslash{}exists type a ; p(a) \&\& q(a)}, the
constraint \texttt{p} is followed by a conjunction. We say there exists
an element such that it satisfies the property \texttt{p} at the same
time it also satisfies \texttt{q}. If we use an implication, as we do
for ``forall'', such an expression will always be true if \texttt{p} is
not a tautology! Why? Is there an ``a'' such that p(a) implies q(a) ? Let
us take a ``a'' such that p(a) is false, then the implication is true.



This part of the invariant deserves a particular attention:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
//@ loop invariant \forall size_t j; 0 <= j < i ==> array[j] != element;
\end{CodeBlock}



Indeed, it defines the treatment performed by our loop, it indicates to
WP what happens inside the loop (or more precisely: what we learn) along
the execution. Here, this formula indicates that at each iteration of
the loop, we know that for each memory location between 0 and the next
location to visit (\CodeInline{i} excluded), the memory location contains a
value different from the element we are looking for.

The proof obligation associated to the preservation of this invariant is
a bit complex and it is not really interesting to precisely look at it,
on the contrary, the proof that the invariant is established before
executing the loop is interesting:



\image{trivial}[Trivial goal]


We note that this property, while quite complex, is proved easily
by Qed. If we look at the parts of the programs on which the proof
relies, we can see that the instruction \CodeInline{i = 0} is highlighted
and this is, indeed, the last instruction executed on \CodeInline{i} before
we start the loop. And consequently, if we replace the value of
\CodeInline{i} by 0 inside the formula of the invariant, we get:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
//@ loop invariant \forall size_t j; 0 <= j < 0 ==> array[j] != element;
\end{CodeBlock}



``For all j, greater or equal to 0 and strictly lower than 0'', this
part of the formula is necessarily false, our implication is then
necessarily true.



\levelThreeTitle{Examples with mutable arrays}


Let us present two examples with mutation of arrays. One with a mutation
of all memory locations, the other with selective modifications.



\levelFourTitle{Reset}


Let us have a look at the function that resets an array of integer to 0.



\CodeBlockInput{c}{reset.c}



Let us just highlight the function and loop assign clauses. Again, we
can use the notation \CodeInline{n .. m} to indicate which parts of the
array are modified.



\levelFourTitle{Search and replace}
\label{l4:statements-loops-ex-search-and-replace}


The last example we will detail to illustrate the proof of functions
with loops is the algorithm ``search and replace''. This algorithm will
selectively modify values in a range of memory locations. It is
generally harder to guide the tool in such a case, because on one hand
we must keep track of what is modified and what is not, and on the other
hand, the induction relies on this fact.

As an example, the first specification we can write for this function
could be this one:



\CodeBlockInput{c}{search_and_replace-0.c}



We use the logic function \CodeInline{\textbackslash{}at(v, Label)} that gives us the
value of the variable \CodeInline{v} at the program point \CodeInline{Label}.
If we look at the usage of this function here, we see that in the
invariant we try to establish a relation between the old values of the
array and the potentially new values:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
  loop invariant \forall size_t j; 0 <= j < i && \at(array[j], Pre) == old 
                   ==> array[j] == new;
  loop invariant \forall size_t j; 0 <= j < i && \at(array[j], Pre) != old 
                   ==> array[j] == \at(array[j], Pre);
*/
\end{CodeBlock}



For every memory location that contained the value to be replaced, it now must
contain the new value. All other values must remain unchanged. In fact, if we
try to prove this invariant with WP, it fails. In such a case, the simpler
method is to add different assertions that will express the different
intermediate properties using assertions which we expect to be easily proved
and which imply the invariant. Here, we can easily notice that WP does not
succeed in maintaining the knowledge that we have not modified the remaining
part of the array yet:




\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
for(size_t i = 0; i < length; ++i){
    //@assert array[i] == \at(array[i], Pre); // échec de preuve
    if(array[i] == old) array[i] = new;
}
\end{CodeBlock}



We can add this information as an invariant:



\CodeBlockInput[13][26]{c}{search_and_replace-1.c}



And this time the proof will succeed.



\levelThreeTitle{Exercices}

For all these exercices, use the following command line to start verification:

\begin{CodeBlock}{bash}
frama-c-gui -wp -wp-rte -warn-unsigned-overflow your-file.c
\end{CodeBlock}  

\levelFourTitle{Non-mutating: Forall, Exists, ...}


Currently, function pointers are not supported by WP. Let us consider that
we have a function:


\CodeBlockInput[3][9]{c}{ex-1-forall-exists.c}


Write your own code and corresponding post-condition and then write the
following functions together with their contract and prove their correctness.

\begin{itemize}
\item \CodeInline{forall\_pred} returns true if and only if \CodeInline{pred}
  is true for all elements ;
\item \CodeInline{exists\_pred} returns true if and only if \CodeInline{pred}
  is true for at least one element ;
\item \CodeInline{none\_pred} returns true if and only if \CodeInline{pred}
  is false for all elements ;
\item \CodeInline{some\_not\_pred} returns true if and only if \CodeInline{pred}
  is false for at least one element.
\end{itemize}

The two last functions should be written by just calling the two first ones.


\levelFourTitle{Non-mutating: Equality of ranges}


Write, specify and prove the function \CodeInline{equal} that returns true if
and only if two ranges of values equal. Write, using the equal function, the
code of \CodeInline{different} that returns if two ranges are different, your
postcondition should contain an existantial quantifier.


\CodeBlockInput[3][9]{c}{ex-2-equal.c}


\levelFourTitle{Binary Search}
\label{l4:statements-loops-ex-bsearch}

The following function searches for the position of a particular value in an
array, assuming that this array is sorted. First, let us consider that the
length of the array is an int and use int values to deal with indexes. One
could note that there are two behavior: either the value exists in the array
(and the result is the index of this value) or not (and the result is -1).


\CodeBlockInput{c}{ex-3-binary-search.c}


This function is a bit tricky to prove, so let us provide some hints. First,
this time the length is provided as an int, so we need to further restrict
this value to make it coherent. Second, one of the invariant properties
should state the bounds of \CodeInline{low} and \CodeInline{up}, but note
that for both of them one of the bounds is not needed. Finally, the second
invariant property should state that if some index of the array stores the
value, this index must be correctly bounded.


\textbf{Harder:} Modify this function in order to recieve \CodeInline{len}
as a \CodeInline{size\_t}. You will have to slightly modify the algorithm
and the proof. As an hint, we advise make \CodeInline{up} and excluded
bound for the research.


\levelFourTitle{Mutating: Addition of vectors}


Write, specify and prove the function that adds two vectors into a third
one. Put arbitrary constraints to solve the integer overflow. Consider that
the resulting vector is entirely separated from the input vectors, however
the same vector should be usable for both input vectors.


\CodeBlockInput[3][5]{c}{ex-4-add-vectors.c}


\levelFourTitle{Mutating: Reverse}


Write, specify and prove the function that reverses a vector inplace. Take
care of the unmodified part of the vector at some iteration of the loop.
Use the previously proved \CodeInline{swap} function.


\CodeBlockInput[3][7]{c}{ex-5-reverse.c}


\levelFourTitle{Mutating: Copy}


Write, specify and prove the function \CodeInline{copy} that copies a range
of values into another array. First consider (and specify) that the two ranges
are entirely separated.


\CodeBlockInput[3][5]{c}{ex-6-copy.c}


\textbf{Harder:} The true copy and copy backward functions

In fact, a strong separation is not necessary. The actual precondition must
guarantee that if the two arrays overlap, the beginning of the destination
range must not be in the source range:

\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
//@ requires \separated(&src[0 .. len-1], src) ;
\end{CodeBlock}


In essence, by copying the element in that order, we can shift elements from
the end of a particular range to the beginning. However, that means that we
have to be more precise in our contract: we do not guarantee anymore an equality
with the values of the source array but with the \emph{old} values of the
source array. And we have also to be more precise in our invariant, first by
also specifying the relation in regard to the previous state of the memory, and
second by adding an invariant that shows that the source array is not modified
from the \CodeInline{i} we are visiting to the end.


Finally, it is also possible to write a function that copies the elements from
the end to the beginning, in this case, again, arrays can overlap but the
condition is not exactly the same. Write, specify and prove the function
\CodeInline{copy\_backward} that copies element in reverse order.
