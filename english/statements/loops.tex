Loops need a particular treatment in deductive verification of
programs. These are the only control structures that will require
important work from us. We cannot avoid this because without loops, it
is difficult to write and prove interesting programs.



Before we look at the way we specify loop, we can answer to a rightful
question: why are loops so complex?



\levelThreeTitle{Induction and invariant}
\label{l3:statements-loops-invariant}


The nature of loops makes their analysis complex. When we perform our
reasoning, we need a rule to determine the precondition from a given sequence
of instructions and a postcondition. Here, the problem is that we cannot
\emph{a priori} deduce how many times a loop iterates, and consequently, we
cannot know how many times variables are modified.



We then proceed using an inductive reasoning. We have to find a
property that is true before we start to execute the loop and that, if
it is true at the beginning of an iteration, remains true at the end
(and that is consequently true at the beginning of the next iteration).
When the loop ends, we add the knowledge that the condition of the loop is
false and that should allow us to deduce that the postcondition of the loop
is verified.



This type of property is called a loop invariant. A loop invariant is a
property that must be true before and after each loop iteration. And more
precisely, each time the condition of the loop is checked. For example with
the following loop:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
for(int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i){ /* */ }
\end{CodeBlock}



The property $0 \leq \texttt{i} \leq 10$ is a loop invariant. The property
$-42 \leq \texttt{i} \leq 42$ is also an invariant (even if it is far less
precise). The property $0 < \texttt{i} \leq 10$ is not an invariant because it is
not true at the beginning of the execution of the loop. The property
$0 \leq \texttt{i} < 10$ \textbf{is not a loop invariant}, it is not true at the
end of the last iteration that sets the value of \CodeInline{i} to $10$.

To verify an invariant $I$, WP then produces the following
``reasoning'':
\begin{itemize}
\item
  verify that $I$ is true at the beginning of the loop (establishment)
\item
  verify that if $I$ is true before an iteration, then $I$ is true
  after (preservation).
\end{itemize}

\levelFourTitle{Formal - Inference rule}

Let us note the invariant $I$, the inference rule corresponding to
loops is defined as follows:
$$\dfrac{\{I \wedge B \}\ c\ \{I\}}{\{I\}\ while(B)\{c\}\ \{I \wedge \neg B\}}$$

And the weakest precondition calculus is the following:
$$wp(while (B) \{ c \}, Post) := I \wedge ((B \wedge I) \Rightarrow wp(c, I)) \wedge ((\neg B \wedge I) \Rightarrow Post)$$
Let us detail this formula:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
  \item
    The first $I$ corresponds to the establishment of the invariant,
    in layman's terms, this is the ``precondition'' of the loop.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The second part of the conjunction
  ($(B \wedge I) \Rightarrow wp(c, I)$) corresponds to the
  verification of the operation performed by the body of the loop:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    the precondition that we know of the loop body (let us note $KWP$,
    ``Known WP'') is ($KWP = B \wedge I$). That is the fact we have
    entered the loop ($B$ is true), and that the invariant is verified
    at this moment ($I$, is true before we start the loop by (1), and
    we want to verify that it will be true at the end of the body of the
    loop in (2)),
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \item
      it remains to verify that $KWP$ implies the actual precondition*
      of the body of the loop ($KWP \Rightarrow wp(c, Post)$). What we
      want at the end of the loop is the preservation of the invariant
      $I$ ($B$ is maybe not true anymore however), formally
      $KWP \Rightarrow wp(c, I)$, that is to say
      $(B \wedge I) \Rightarrow wp(c, I)$,
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    * it corresponds to the application of the consequence rule
    previously explained.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Finally, the last part ($(\neg B \wedge I) \Rightarrow Post$)
  expresses the fact that when the loop ends($\neg B$), and the
  invariant $I$ has been maintained, it must imply that the wanted
  postcondition of the loop is verified.
\end{itemize}

In this computation, we can notice that the $wp$ function does not
indicate any way to obtain the invariant $I$. We have to specify
ourselves this property about our loops.



\levelFourTitle{Back to the WP plugin}


There exist tools that can infer invariant properties (provided that
these properties are simple, automatic tools remain limited). This is not
the case for WP. We have to manually annotate our programs to
specify the invariant of each loop. To find and write invariants for our
loops will always be the hardest part of our work when we want to prove
programs.



Indeed, when there are no loops, the weakest precondition calculus
function can automatically provide the verifiable properties of our
programs, this is not the case for loop invariant properties for which we
do not have computation procedures. We have to find and express them
correctly, and depending on the algorithm, they can be quite subtle and
complex.



In order to specify a loop invariant, we add the following annotations
before the loop:



\CodeBlockInput[6]{c}{first_loop-1.c}



\begin{Warning}
  \textbf{REMINDER} : The invariant is: i \textbf{$\leq$} 30 !
\end{Warning}


Why? Because along the loop, \CodeInline{i} is comprised between 0 and
\textbf{included} 30. 30 is indeed the value that allows us to leave the
loop. Moreover, one of the properties required by the weakest
precondition calculus is that when the loop condition is invalidated, by
knowing the invariant, we can prove the postcondition (Formally
$(\neg B \wedge I) \Rightarrow Post$).

The postcondition of our loop is $\texttt{i} = 30$ and must be implied
by $\neg\ \texttt{i} < 30\ \wedge\ 0 \leq \texttt{i} \leq 30$. Here, it is
true since:
$$\texttt{i} \geq 30 \wedge 0 \leq \texttt{i} \leq 30 \Rightarrow \texttt{i} = 30$$
On the opposite, if we exclude the equality to 30, the postcondition
would be unreachable.



Again, we can have a look at the list of verification conditions in
``WP Goals'':



\image{i_30-1}


We notice that WP produces two different verification conditions: the
establishment of the invariant and its preservation. WP produces exactly
the reasoning we previously described to prove the assertion. In recent
versions of Frama-C, Qed has become particularly aggressive and
powerful, and the generated verification condition does not show those details
(showing directly ``True''). Using the option \texttt{-wp-no-simpl} at
start, we can however see these details:



\image{i_30-2}


But is our specification precise enough?



\CodeBlockInput{c}{first_loop-2.c}



And the result is:



\image{i_30-3}


It seems not.



\levelThreeTitle{The \texttt{assigns} clause \ldots{} for loops}


In fact, considering loops, WP \textbf{only} reasons about what is
provided by the user to perform its reasoning. And here, the invariant
does not specify anything about the way the value of \CodeInline{h} is
modified (or not). We could specify the invariant of all program
variables, but it would be a lot of work. ACSL simply allows adding
\CodeInline{assigns} annotations for loops. Any other variable is considered
to keep its old value. For example:



\CodeBlockInput{c}{first_loop-3.c}



This time, we can establish the proof that the loop correctly behaves.
However, we cannot prove that it terminates. The loop invariant alone
does not give enough information to perform such a proof. For example,
in our program, we could modify the loop, removing the loop body:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
  loop invariant 0 <= i <= 30;
  loop assigns i;
*/
while(i < 30){

}
\end{CodeBlock}



The invariant is still verified, but we cannot prove that the loop ends:
it is infinite.



\levelThreeTitle{Partial correctness and total correctness - Loop variant}
\label{l3:statements-loops-variant}


In deductive verification, we find two types of correctness, the partial
correctness and the total correctness. In the first case, the
formulation of the correctness property is ``if the precondition is
valid, and \textbf{if} the computation terminates, then the
postcondition is valid''. In the second case, ``if the precondition is
valid, \textbf{then} the computation terminates and the postcondition is
valid''. By default, WP considers only partial correctness:



\CodeBlockInput{c}{infinite.c}



If we try to verify this code activating the verification of absence of
RTE, we get this result:



\image{infinite}



The assertion ``False'' is proved! For a very simple reason: since the
condition of the loop is ``True'' and no instruction of the loop body
allows to leave the loop, it does not terminate. As we are proving the
code with partial correctness, and as the execution does not terminate,
we can prove anything about the code that follows the non-terminating
part of the code. However, if the termination is not trivially provable,
the assertion will probably not be proved.



\begin{Information}
  Note that a (provably) unreachable assertion is always proved to be true:
  \image{goto_end}
  And this is also the case when we trivially know that an instruction
  produces a runtime error (for example dereferencing \CodeInline{NULL}), or
  inserting ``False'' in postcondition as we have already seen with
  \CodeInline{abs} and the parameter \CodeInline{INT\_MIN}.
\end{Information}


\levelFourTitle{Proof of termination - Providing a measure}
\label{l4:statements-loops-variant-measure}


In program proof, when we need to prove termination of an algorithm, we
introduce a notion of \textit{measure}. A measure is an expression that must be
strictly decreasing according to a given
\externalLink{well-founded relation}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation}
$R$. From a ``step'' of the computation to another, we want the measure to
decrease according to $R$. In ACSL, by default, the measure is an integer
expression that must be decreasing and positive:
$R(x,y) \Leftrightarrow x > y \wedge x \geq 0$, but one can specify another
relation (see Section~\ref{l4:statements-loops-general-measure}).


For loops, the measure is specified through a loop variant, and the notion of
``step'' in the computation is the loop iteration. A loop variant is not a
property but an expression that involves some variables modified
by the loop and that provides an upper bound to the number of iterations that
remains to be executed by the loop before any iteration. Thus, this expression
is greater or equals to 0, and strictly decreases at each loop iteration. Now,
since for any loop iteration the value decreases, but it remains positive, that
means that the loop necessarily stops after a finite number of iterations.


If we take our previous example, we add the loop variant with this
syntax:


\CodeBlockInput{c}{first_loop-4.c}


Again, we can have a look at the generated verification conditions:


\image{i_30-4}


WP generates two verification conditions for the loop variant: verify that the
value of the expression specified in the variant is positive, and prove that it
strictly decreases during the execution of the loop. And if we delete the line
of code that increments \CodeInline{i}, WP cannot prove anymore that
\CodeInline{30\ -\ i} strictly decreases.


We can also note that, since the loop variant is an upper bound on the number of
remaining iterations, being able to give a loop variant does not necessarily
induce that we can give the exact number of remaining iterations of the loop, as
we do not always have a so precise knowledge of the behavior of the program. We
can for example build an example like this one:


\CodeBlockInput{c}{random_loop.c}


Here, at each iteration, we decrease the value of the variable \CodeInline{i} by
a value comprised between 1 and \CodeInline{i}. Thus, we can ensure that the
value of \CodeInline{i} is positive and strictly decreases during each loop
iteration, but we cannot tell how many loop iterations remain to be executed.


Note also that a loop variant only needs to be positive at the beginning
of the execution of the block of the loop. Thus, in the following code:


\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
int i = 5 ;
while(i >= 0){
  i -= 2 ;
}
\end{CodeBlock}

Even if \CodeInline{i} can be negative when the loop exits, it is still
a variant since we do not start the execution of the block of the loop
again.


\levelFourTitle{General measure}
\label{l4:statements-loops-general-measure}


\begin{Information}
  In this short section, we present a particular usage of loop variants. It uses
  an ACSL feature that is presented in the next part of the tutorial, yet the
  section should be understandable without having read the next part. Note that,
  since this way of using loop variants is rarely useful, it can be ignored in a
  first read.
\end{Information}


Most of the time a simple integer measure is enough to express loop variants
and prove termination of loops. However, in some situations, it might be hard to
use. In such a case, ACSL allows the notion of generalized variant where one can
specify an expression of any type, as long as they can provide a well-founded
relation that correspond to this type. However, WP \textbf{does not} verify that
the provided relation is well-founded, it must be proved in some other way.
Such a measure is provided through the following syntax:


\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@ loop variant <term> for <Relation> ;
\end{CodeBlock}


The \CodeInline{Relation} predicate must be a defined binary predicates of the
type of \CodeInline{term}. Let us illustrate this with the following example:


\CodeBlockInput[6]{c}{general-measure.c}


We will describe more precisely user-defined predicates in
Section~\ref{l2:acsl-properties-predicates}, for now let us consider that
the ACSL code on lines 12--15 defines some kind of function that takes to
structures in input and returns a boolean value. Here, instead of using an
integer for our measure, we use a structure that contains two integers. The
\CodeInline{lexico} predicate defines a lexicographical order over the
structures of type \CodeInline{pair}. If we look at the generated verification
condition, in the ``Prove'' part, we see that we must prove
\CodeInline{P\_lexico(p, p\_1)}, that uses our user-defined predicate.


Note that unlike the default \CodeInline{loop variant} clause, this clause
generates a single verification condition. Indeed, in WP, the default relation
$R(x,y) \Leftrightarrow x > y \wedge x \geq 0$ is split into $x > y$ and
$x \geq 0$, but for a user-defined relation, it is not necessarily possible to
do so, thus WP never tries to do it.


\levelThreeTitle{Create a link between postcondition and invariant}


Let us consider the following specified program. Our goal is to prove
that this function returns the old value of \CodeInline{a} plus 10.



\CodeBlockInput{c}{add_ten-0.c}



The weakest precondition calculus does not allow deducing information
that is not part of the loop invariant. In a code like:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
    ensures \result == \old(a) + 10;
*/
int add_ten(int a){
    ++a;
    ++a;
    ++a;
    //...
    return a;
}
\end{CodeBlock}


By reading the instructions backward
from the postcondition, we always keep all knowledge about \CodeInline{a}. On
the opposite, as we previously mentioned, outside the loop, WP only
considers the information provided by the invariant. Consequently, our
\CodeInline{add\_ten} function cannot be proved: the invariant does not say anything
about \CodeInline{a}. To create a link between the postcondition and the
invariant, we have to add this knowledge. See, for example:



\CodeBlockInput{c}{add_ten-1.c}



\begin{Information}
  This need can appear as a very strong constraint. This is not really the
  case. There exists strongly automated analysis that can compute loop
  invariant properties. For example, without a specification, an abstract
  interpretation would easily compute \CodeInline{0 <= i <= 10}
  and \CodeInline{old(a) <= a <= \textbackslash{}old(a)+10}.
  However, it is often more difficult to compute the relations
  that exist between the different variables of a program, for
  example the equality expressed by the invariant we have
  added and that is absolutely necessary to prove the postcondition of the
  function.
\end{Information}


\levelThreeTitle{Multiple loop invariants}


We can specify several \CodeInline{loop invariant} clauses on a loop. There are
similarities in the way assertions and loop invariants are handled. Namely, just
like when an assertion follows another, it can be proved using the previous one
as a hypothesis, like in:
\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
assert A1: P(x);
assert A2: Q(x);
\end{CodeBlock}
where \CodeInline{A2} can be proved with \CodeInline{A1} in hypothesis, the same
happens with loop invariants. However, there are some subtleties. Let us
consider the following situation:


\CodeBlockInput[5]{c}{two-loop-invariants.c}


Here, we have 4 verification conditions to prove:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \CodeInline{I1} is established,
  \item \CodeInline{I2} is established,
  \item \CodeInline{I1} is preserved by each loop iteration,
  \item \CodeInline{I2} is preserved by each loop iteration.
\end{itemize}
For \CodeInline{I1} establishment, there is not much to say: WP generates a
verification condition with all hypotheses that lead to the loop (so just the
fact that \CodeInline{x} is 0) and we have to prove that \CodeInline{0 <= x}
(we have used the option \CodeInline{-wp-no-let} to avoid immediate proof by
Qed):


\image{2-invs-I1-est}


For \CodeInline{I2}, it is quite similar \emph{but} since we have proved that
\CodeInline{I1} is established, we also add it as a hypothesis for proving that
\CodeInline{I2} is established:


\image{2-invs-I2-est}


If there was a third loop invariant \CodeInline{I3}, the proof of its
establishment would receive both the establishment of \CodeInline{I1} and
\CodeInline{I2} as a hypothesis and so on.


Then, we have to prove that \CodeInline{I1} and \CodeInline{I2} are preserved by
each loop iteration. For proving that \CodeInline{I1} is preserved, we assume
that all loop invariants are verified before the loop iteration, and we prove
that \CodeInline{I1} is still true at the end of the iteration. However, we can
add more assumptions. In particular, we can add that all loop invariants have
been established before the loop starts. Thus, we get:
\begin{itemize}
  \item assuming that \CodeInline{I1} and \CodeInline{I2} were verified when the
        loop started,
  \item assuming also that all loop invariants are verified when the iteration
        starts,
  \item prove that \CodeInline{I1} is still true at the end of the iteration.
\end{itemize}
Note that we have slightly simplified the goal to focus on what is important
here:


\image{2-invs-I1-pres}


Finally, when proving that \CodeInline{I2} is preserved, we can collect even
more hypotheses since we also know that \CodeInline{I1} is preserved thus:
\begin{itemize}
  \item assuming that \CodeInline{I1} and \CodeInline{I2} were verified when the
        loop started,
  \item assuming also that all loop invariant are verified when the iteration
        starts,
  \item assuming that \CodeInline{I1} is preserved,
  \item prove that \CodeInline{I2} is still true at the end of the iteration.
\end{itemize}
Again, and so on when there are more \CodeInline{loop invariant} clauses.


\image{2-invs-I2-pres}


\levelThreeTitle{Different kinds of loop invariants}


Just like the \CodeInline{assert} clause that have the two variants
\CodeInline{check} and \CodeInline{admit}, one can specify that some
loop invariants must be only checked or admitted. The syntax is the following:


\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@ check loop invariant <property> ;
    admit loop invariant <property> ;
\end{CodeBlock}


Again, this has an impact on generated verification conditions and related
hypotheses.


The behavior associated to the \CodeInline{admit loop invariant} clause does not
involve any particular subtlety. It is assumed exactly in the same situations as
the standard \CodeInline{loop invariant} clause, so that the only difference
between the two clauses is the fact that WP never generates a verification
condition to check that the \CodeInline{admit loop invariant} clause is indeed
true.


The \CodeInline{check loop invariant} clause is slightly more complex to deal
with. Since this clause must be checked to be true, WP generate verification
conditions for it just like for standard \CodeInline{loop invariant} clause.
Then, since it is only checked, one must not assume that it is true for proving
other properties. However, for proving that the \CodeInline{check loop invariant}
clause is preserved, one still has to assume that it is true at the beginning of
the iteration but \textit{only} for this proof of preservation (not for all other
loop invariants).


Let us illustrate the behavior with the different verification conditions of
\CodeInline{C3} and \CodeInline{I4} in the following code snippet (again, we
use \CodeInline{-wp-no-let}, and the verification conditions have been slightly
cleaned):


\CodeBlockInput[5]{c}{check-admit-invariant.c}


The verification condition associated to the establishment of \CodeInline{C3} is
quite simple, since it appears after the loop invariants \CodeInline{I1} and
\CodeInline{A2} that must be both admitted (even if \CodeInline{A2} has not been
proved by WP), we have those two properties in the hypotheses:


\image{check-loop-est}


The verification condition associated to the establishment of \CodeInline{I4} is
more interesting: it still receives \CodeInline{I1} and \CodeInline{A2} in the
hypotheses, but \CodeInline{C3} is not there because it is only checked and not
admitted after that:


\image{inv-loop-est}


Then, we can have a look to the preservation of these invariants. For
\CodeInline{C3}, in the hypotheses, we find:
\begin{itemize}
  \item all the established invariants, including \CodeInline{C3},
  \item all the invariants assumed (induction hypothesis), including \CodeInline{C3},
  \item all the invariants that precede \CodeInline{C3}, assumed to be preserved.
\end{itemize}


\image{check-loop-pres}


On the opposite, if we look at the preservation of \CodeInline{I4}, in the
hypotheses, we find:
\begin{itemize}
  \item all the established invariants, excluding \CodeInline{C3},
  \item all the invariants assumed (induction hypothesis), excluding \CodeInline{C3},
  \item all the invariants that precede \CodeInline{I4}, assumed to be preserved,
        excluding \CodeInline{C3}.
\end{itemize}


\image{inv-loop-pres}


Understanding how loop invariant are used by WP depending on the order in which
they appear is useful to prove complex invariants. The more we provide useful
hypotheses for a proof, the easier the proof will be. In particular, Qed can do
a lot of simplification by rewriting hypotheses using deduction rules. Thus,
providing first the simplest invariants and then the most complex can help the
proof process by first proving easy properties and then using the acquired
knowledge to prove the most complex ones.


\levelThreeTitle{Early termination of loop}


A loop invariant must be true each time the condition of the loop is checked. In
fact, that also means that it must be true before an iteration, and after
each \textbf{complete} iteration. Let us illustrate on an example this
important idea.



\CodeBlockInput{c}{first_loop-non-term-1.c}



In this function, when the loop reaches the index 30, we break the loop before
checking the condition again. While the invariant is verified, let us show
that we can now further constrain it.



\CodeBlockInput{c}{first_loop-non-term-2.c}



Here we can see that we have excluded 30 from the range of values of
\CodeInline{i} and everything is still verified by WP. This is particularly
interesting because it does not apply only to the invariant, none of the loop
properties need to be verified in this last iteration. For example, we can
write this code that is still verified:



\CodeBlockInput{c}{first_loop-non-term-3.c}



We can see that we can write the variable \CodeInline{h} even if it is not
listed in the \CodeInline{loop assigns} clause, and that we can give the
value 42 to \CodeInline{i} which does not respect the invariant, and also
makes the expression of the variant negative. In fact, everything happens
as if we had written:



\CodeBlockInput{c}{first_loop-non-term-4.c}



This is an interesting scheme. It basically corresponds to any algorithm
that searches, using a loop, a particular condition verified by an element
in a given data-structure and stops when it founds it to perform some
operations that are thus not really part of the loop. From a verification
point of view, it allows us to simplify the contract of the loop: we know
that the (potentially complex) operations performed just before we stop do
not need to be considered when designing the invariant.


\levelThreeTitle{Exercises}

Write a suitable invariant for the following loop and prove it using
